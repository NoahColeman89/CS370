•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project I had to create a Q-learning algorithm that would find the fastest path from the start to the treasure.  We were given the code to store the memory of each attempt, the layout of the maze as a matrix, the basic functionality of the game, and the skeleton of the neural network.  We were also provided with pseudocode to help us create the intelligent agent.  We had to complete the code in order to make the agent either exploit or explore.  We also had to give rewards for correct decisions.  Finally, we had to verify if the pirate had won or lost. 
•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create code that makes the average person’s life easier.  As computer programs become more efficient people are able to focus less on certain tasks and more on things they enjoy.  Computer scientists also design AI, which can potentially be a lifesaving creation.
o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist problem must be broken down piece by piece.  We have to think about what the final goal is, and how we can get there.  Additionally once we find a solution, we have to look for more efficient solutions and reiterate through the problem, continually making it better.
o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities are to make code that is fair, and that does not violate any laws or organizational policies.  Do no harm is a good ethical standard to code by.
